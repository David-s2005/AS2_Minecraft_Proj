    <h1>About 2DayBan</h1>

    <div class="main-paragraph">
        <p style="font-size: 24px;">
            2DayBan is a repository of my work, past projects, art and blogs about music. 2DayBan is
            also a creative outlet, it enable me to use my technical skills in a tangible way and
            allows me to develop my creative and technical skills.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p style="font-size: 24px;">
            There are 4 pages, the projects page serves as a the main repository of my work. It will
            mainly contain computer programs i've made, how they work and how to use them. The projects
            page can also host my art, if i ever make something worth uploading.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p style="font-size: 24px;">
            The Github page is just a hyperlink to my GitHub where website visitors can find all my
            computer projects, they'll mostly find my boring TAFE projects but worthwhile projects
            will eventually be placed on the page.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p style="font-size: 24px;">
            The Others page will be a selection of my socials, so PCPartPicker, Discord, Outlook, etc.
            This will provide visitors of my site a way to contact me, which will be useful if i ever
            show a potential employer my website.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p style="font-size: 24px;">
            2DayBan can be used as a digital business card, it is a demonstration of my technical skills
            and can be used to help convince a potential employer of my technical skills. The website will
            evolve as my technical skills develop and will look more impressive to employers.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p style="font-size: 24px;">
            2DayBan can eventually use webassembly which can be compiled from Rust, a language im half
            decent at. This opens many opportunities, like making a ray-tracer on the web, games and
            others.
        </p>

    <h1>License</h1>

    <div class="license-paragraph">
        <p style="font-size: 24px;">
            2DayBan will use a creative commons license. This is because 2DayBan is mainly a artistic
            project that im fine with others using with credit and because i dont feel the need to
            protect my intellectual property.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p style="font-size: 24px;">
            Employers may potentially see my site, so i need to ensure that i can demonstrate that
            my website is original and mine. A creative commons license allows people to remix my work
            under the stipulation that they must credit me, helping to ensure credit it given to me
            and to prove 2DayBan is mine.
